## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I plan to create a tabletop game review site. Users will be able to search for games
they would like to buy and then browse reviews of said game in order 
to help them make their purchasing decision. In addition to the search feature,
users can create an account in order to submit their own reviews. Beyond that, I hope to 
add a messaging or forum feature that will allow users to discuss and debate with one another
about the merits or faults of various games. I would also like to include a marketplace feature 
that will allow users to immediately buy a game that they find intriguing. 

I love playing tabletop games. However, I still find it hard to settle on 
what game to buy next. They can be expensive, and it is disappointing to spend money on something 
that ends up being too simple, too complicated, or just plain unclear with rules. Game review sites 
are an asset when trying to settle on a decision.

### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create accounts, and log in to the application in order to 
submit reviews.
Search: Users will be able to search for tabletop games by name.
Create Reviews: Users will be able to submit reviews for tabletop games.
Marketplace: Users will be able to buy games.

Optional Features:
Photo Upload and Sharing: Users can create a profile and upload images to their page. Users can 
connect with one another through messaging and share info and photos.
Google Maps: Users can find a physical game shop near them, or connect with other players to try
out a game before buying.

### What I'll Have to Learn

JavaScript to make the site more attractive and interactive.
